            As the main goal of the project is to organize Dive Records in a programatic fashion, you would use 
            this system to store your diving logs, and the system will relate the incumbent personnel, equipment
            and procedures, provide you with reports and metrics of your performance and allow you to monitor your
            career with an unprecedented level of detail that you can then use for: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Certification and Re-certification purposes</li>
            <li>Job Search and Proof of experience</li>
            <li>Health and the how it relates to your dives</li>

            <li>Safety considerations</li>
            <li>Diving procedures</li>
            <li>Weather Conditions</li>
            <li>Professional Context (contractors and client company names, location, deployment platforms)</li>
